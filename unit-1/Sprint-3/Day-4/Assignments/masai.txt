Masai is a best platform to learn coding to build  career , no matters from which background you belongs too , here the key feature is that we do not have to pay anything untill & unless we got hired for a job of 5 LPA or above , in this great organisation you can build & enhace your logic & communication skills , 
			
			My personel experience with masai is very well & phantastic  I am learning basic javacript now & i though in most of CS courses it has been taught in 2nd year , but we are learning it now so it seems very well that we are preparing 1 step forward in comparison of others , but masai never taught us to compare ourself with anyone else they only taught us to compare yourself from what you was yesterday , if we are in masai we need to improve us on daily basis, that was from my side thank you so much.
